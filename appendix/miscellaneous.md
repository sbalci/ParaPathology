**Virtual 2025 QuPath Training Course:** From Samples to KnowledgeThank you for your interest in our training course! We will broadcast the course in real time on Zoom. While we won't have the ability to directly assist you, we will have a way for you to ask questions which will be reviewed and, if time allows, answered during the course. Please fill out the form below and we will email you the meeting details and zoom link when available. You will also get installation instructions, and links to files, presentations, and projects. The training course will take place on February 24-25, 2025 between 9 and 5 pm PST. We will not stream or record the Advanced User's Meeting on February 26 in order to protect preliminary data.
