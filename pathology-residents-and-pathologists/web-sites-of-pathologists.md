Written by my erudite partner, Gerry del Junco, MD, this 73-page formatted document is the ultimate pathology Board-review resource in intestinal pathology. Just add photos, and you've got the equivalent of a $200 subspecialty textbook for free (non-commercial use only, please). This is the 2002 revision. 393K.
>
> ["Surgical Pathology Quality Assurance Score Sheet"](http://web2.airmail.net/uthman/pdf\_documents/qa\_score\_sheet.pdf) is a weighted scoring form for reporting QA case reviews in surgical pathology. Every case starts with a "zero" score and gets points deducted for various deficiencies. Guidelines are given for how many points to deduct for each peccadillo. There is also a [native version](http://web2.airmail.net/uthman/QASCORE.DOC) of this 8K file in [Microsoft Word](http://www.microsoft.com/word/) format, for those who wish to edit it.

>
> [RhoGam Flowchart](http://web2.airmail.net/uthman/RhoGam\_Flowchart\_2012.pdf) is an algorithm for working up parturient mothers for treatment with Rh(D)-immune globulin (RhoGam). This is used to prevent hemolytic disease of the newborn in subsequent pregnancies in Rh(D)-negative women.

> ["Placenta"](http://web2.airmail.net/uthman/placenta.sit) is a **downloadable**[Stuffit](http://www.aladdinsys.com/consumer/expander1.html) archive containing my spreadsheet for calculating normal ranges of placental weights and plotting an individual patient's placental weight on the resulting nomogram. The spreadsheet can be modified with your institution's logo and your personal signature line by anyone who has a bit of working knowledge of [Microsoft Excel](http://www.microsoft.com/office/excel/default.asp). There are two files in the archive. PLACENTA.XLS is the spreadsheet template itself, and PLACDOC.TXT is documentation on how to use the spreadsheet. Public domain, 15K.
>
> ["Grouper"](http://web2.airmail.net/uthman/grouper.sit) (version 2.1) is a Microsoft Excel worksheet that accepts up to 1000 numerical datapoints, calculates descriptive statistics of the sample, collates the data into a user- specified number of groups, and draws a histogram of the grouped data. It can also accept user-specified exclusion criteria, allowing outliers to be filtered out of the dataset before the histogram is constructed. I developed it as an aid to determine lab test reference ranges. This is a Stuffit archive containing the spreadsheet, GROUPER.XLS, and the documentation, GROUPER.TXT. Public domain, 56K.
>
> ["A Taxonomic Guide to the Pathology Kingdom"](http://web2.airmail.net/uthman/pthcreer.ppt) is a PowerPoint presentation on pathology as a career, comparing the world of academic pathology with that of private practice. This will be pretty obscure for anyone who is not fascinated by scientific names of biological species. You have been warned. 44K.

> ["Placenta"](http://web2.airmail.net/uthman/placenta.sit) is a **downloadable**[Stuffit](http://www.aladdinsys.com/consumer/expander1.html) archive containing my spreadsheet for calculating normal ranges of placental weights and plotting an individual patient's placental weight on the resulting nomogram. The spreadsheet can be modified with your institution's logo and your personal signature line by anyone who has a bit of working knowledge of [Microsoft Excel](http://www.microsoft.com/office/excel/default.asp). There are two files in the archive. PLACENTA.XLS is the spreadsheet template itself, and PLACDOC.TXT is documentation on how to use the spreadsheet. Public domain, 15K.

It can also accept user-specified exclusion criteria, allowing outliers to be filtered out of the dataset before the histogram is constructed. I developed it as an aid to determine lab test reference ranges. This is a Stuffit archive containing the spreadsheet, GROUPER.XLS, and the documentation, GROUPER.TXT. Public domain, 56K.
