## Pathologist

* Attributes of a Pathologist

What makes a good pathologist? First of all, I think you have to be good at pattern recognition... You have to be thorough in your thinking, "Well, if I haven't seen this before, what must I do to try and make the diagnosis? Must I do some more special stains? Must I show it to somebody else? Must I read up in the books about it?" And you have to be quite determined to find out. **Paola Domizio** \(UK\)

* This is what we should be doing. Collect, Catalog, Classify and Share. [\#**pathologists**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/pathologists?src=hash) are ambitious collectors who make catalogs of diseases. Collections should be mandatory for residents and educational departments.
