## Pathology reports are the most important medical documents:

* Generally only complete information in a patient file is a pathology report.

## Types of pathology reports

* Free Text
* Structured
* Synoptic

## CAP what is not synoptic report

## CAP video

## Pathology reports suffer from the outside forces:

* Clinicians who do not want (!) "inadequate specimen" reports.
* We change our diagnosis so that clinicians do not misunderstand
* Do not write chronic prostitis because they may assume that elevated PSA levels are due to chronic prostitis ???
*   We change our reports so that patients do not misunderstand

    * Change prostate grading scheme so that patients are grade group 1, not in 6 out of 10.

    * Explanatory notes for patients
* We change tumor names so that insurance firms do not label patients as cancer
  * Change thyoid tumor names (NIFTP)
* **Patoloji Raporunda Yer Alan Tanılar Tekrarlanabilir mi? Are the Pathologic Diagnosis reproducible?**
