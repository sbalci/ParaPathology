#  What is Cancer? 



---


---
#  Cancer is a genetic disease 

+ Genetic changes allow excessive and unregulated proliferation that becomes autonomous (independent of physiologic growth stimuli), although tumors generally remain dependent on the host for their nutrition and blood supply.

#  The field of Cancer Research is broad 

+ Pathology
+ Morphology
+ Pharmacology
+ Genetics
+ Epidemiology
+ Biochemistry
+ System Biology
+ Evolution
+ Population dynamics
+ …
+ AS WELL AS
	+ Quackery, fraudulency, charlatan, cheating ….

---
#  When will there be a cure for cancer? 

+ Which cancer?
+ Hodgkin lymphoma is highly curable
+ Pancreas Cancer is nearly always fatal

---
#  Cancer is a genetic disorder 

+ DNA mutations
	+ acquired spontaneously
	+ induced by environmental insults
+ Epigenetic changes
	+ DNA methylation
	+ Histone modifications
+ Genetic instability
+ Genetic changes affect the ability of
	+ Growth , survival, senescence

---
#  Genetic alterations are heritable 

+ Passed to daughter cells via cell division
+ Cells with growth and survival advantages dominate the population
+ One single cell ultimately gives rise to the tumor   all tumors are clonal

---
#  Hallmarks of Cancer - Properties of Cancer 

+ self -sufficiency in growth signals
	+ whereby the growth of cancers becomes autonomous and is unregulated by physiologic cues
+ lack of response to growth inhibitory signals that control non-neoplastic cellular proliferations such as hyperplasias
+ evasion of cell death, allowing cancer cells to survive under conditions that induce apoptosis in normal cells
+ limitless replicative potential, thus making cancer cells immortal
	+ He-La Cell Line
+ development of angiogenesis to sustain the growth of cancer cells
+ ability to invade local tissues and spread to distant sites
+ reprogramming of metabolic pathways—specifically, a switch to aerobic glycolysis even when there is abundant oxygen
+ ability to evade the immune system

---
#  nomenclature 



---
#  Some Terminology 

+ Aplasia
+ Hyperplasia
+ Metaplasia
+ Neoplasia
+ Dysplasia
+ Tumor
+ Mass
+ Oncology ( oncos : tumor)

---
#  Neoplasia “new growth” 

+ Neoplastic
	+ Transformed
+ C ontinue to replicate
	+ does not take into account the control of normal regulatory influences of growth
	+ Autonomy
		+ Not complete some still require endocrine stimulation, treated as such
+ Increase in size
	+ Depend on the host for nutrition, blood supply

---
#  Benign Tumors 

+ Microscopic and gross characteristics are considered to be relatively innocent
+ remain localized, local surgical removal
+ patient generally survives
+ sometimes they are responsible for serious disease

---
#  Malignant Tumors 

+ Cancers
+ From the Latin word for “crab”
+ Adhere to any part that they seize in an obstinate manner, similar to a crab’s behavior

---

+ Cancer
+ Carcinoma
+ Malignant  Epithelial  Tumor
+ Malignant  Mesenchymal  Tumor
+ Small Blue Round Cell Tumor
+ Leukeima
+ Lymphoma

---
#  Malignant 

+ Invade and destroy adjacent structures
+ Spread to distant sites (metastasize)
+ Cause death
+ Not all cancers go into a deadly course
+ Most aggressive are also some of the most curable

---
#  Tumors have two components 

+ Parenchyma
	+ Transformed or neoplastic cells
+ Stroma
	+ Supporting, host-derived, non-neoplastic stroma
	+ Connective tissue, blood vessels, and host-derived inflammatory cells

---
#  Tumors have two components 

+ Parenchyma
	+ determines its biologic behavior
	+ tumors named according to parenchmal cells
+ Stroma
	+ crucial to the growth of the neoplasm
	+ blood supply
	+ support for the growth
+ A two-way conversation
	+ Epithelial Mesenchymal Interactions / Transitions

---
#  Nomenclature of Neoplasms 

+ A problem of Taxonomy
+ Classification of Neoplasms
+ Subject to change over time
+ Different classification schemes and proposals for each group of tumor
	+ Schools are different:
		+ Japanese, European, North American, South American
	+ Authors from same country also have different opinions

---
#  WHO Classification of Neoplasms 

+ Updated every 5-7 years
+ Aim is:
	+ To form a unified terminology
	+ Define distinct diseases in terms of morphological, clinical, genetic features
	+ Started adding therapeutic subgroups as well

#  Nomenclature of Benign Tumors 

+ Growth type is also used in naming
+ Adenoma
	+ Tumors forming glands
+ Papilloma
	+ Tumors forming papillary (finger-like) features
+ Polyp
	+ Finger like projection on the mucosal surface
	+ General term, does not mean neoplastic (nasal polyp is not neoplastic, but inflammatory)
+ Cystadenoma
	+ Tumors forming cysts
