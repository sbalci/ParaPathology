description: Bladder cancer (BC) remains a major disease burden in terms of incidence, morbidity,mortality, and economic cost. Deciphering the intrinsic molecular subtypes and identificationof key drivers of BC has yielded successful novel therapeutic strategies. Advancesin computational and digital pathology are reshaping the field of anatomical pathology.This review offers an update on the most relevant computational algorithms in digitalpathology that have been proposed to enhance BC management. These tools promise toenhance diagnostics, staging, and grading accuracy and streamline efficiency whileadvancing practice consistency.
