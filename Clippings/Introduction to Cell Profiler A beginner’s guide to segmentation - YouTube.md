Introduction to Cell Profiler: A beginner’s guide to segmentation | Shatavisha Dasgupta | October 17th, Halfway to I2K 2023 Authors: Shatavisha Dasgupta, Imaging Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA Description: Quantitative analysis of optical microscopy images is the cornerstone of modern day biological research. A working knowledge of image analysis and familiarity with image analysis tools is therefore crucial for biologists. CellProfiler is an open-source image analysis software that allows automated, reproducible quantitative analysis of large volumes and wide varieties of microscopic images. This workshop is intended to introduce CellProfiler to biologists who are beginners in image analysis. Attendees would be provided an overview of a standard image analysis workflow in CellProfiler, along with explanation of the individual modules comprising the pipeline. This would be followed by an interactive session with the attendees in which they can practice building a workflow for a particular biological question. Pre-Workshop Instructions: Please download and install the most recent version of CellProfiler for Mac or for Windows. Keywords: Image analysis, biology, segmentation, CellProfiler, computer-assisted image processing
