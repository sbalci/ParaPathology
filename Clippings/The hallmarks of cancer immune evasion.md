## Summary

According to the widely accepted “three Es” model, the host immune system eliminates malignant cell precursors and contains microscopic neoplasms in a dynamic equilibrium, preventing cancer outgrowth until neoplastic cells acquire genetic or epigenetic alterations that enable immune escape. This immunoevasive phenotype originates from various mechanisms that can be classified under a novel “three Cs” conceptual framework: (1) camouflage, which hides cancer cells from immune recognition, (2) coercion, which directly or indirectly interferes with immune effector cells, and (3) cytoprotection, which shields malignant cells from immune cytotoxicity. Blocking the ability of neoplastic cells to evade the host immune system is crucial for increasing the efficacy of modern immunotherapy and conventional therapeutic strategies that ultimately activate anticancer immunosurveillance. Here, we review key hallmarks of cancer immune evasion under the “three Cs” framework and discuss promising strategies targeting such immunoevasive mechanisms.

**The expanding role for small molecules in immuno-oncology**

*Nat. Rev. Drug Discov.* 2022; **21**:821-840Inspired by the “three Es” model, we propose that the mechanisms through which cancer cells evade tumor-targeting immunity can be interpreted under a “three Cs” conceptual framework involving camouflage, coercion, and cytoprotection, which refer to the ability of some malignant cells to evade recognition by the immune system (i.e., not be found by immune effector cells or not be identified as malignant), directly or indirectly interfere with immune effector cells (i.e., once found by immune effector cells and identified as malignant, prevent immune cell activation), and protect themselves from immune cytotoxicity (i.e., resist effector molecules normally released upon immune cell activation), respectively ([Figure 1](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#fig1)). In addition to reviewing these hallmarks of cancer immunoevasion under the “three Cs” paradigm, here, we discuss promising strategies to prevent or reverse such immunoevasive mechanisms for therapeutic purposes. Importantly, host alterations related to these hallmarks, including (1) polymorphisms in genes encoding key receptors, (2) immunological alterations of the tumor microenvironment (TME) driven by non-malignant cells, (3) defects in the whole-body ecosystem that are not elicited by neoplastic cells, go beyond the scope of the present review and hence will not be discussed.

Figure 1 The “three Cs” of cancer immune evasion

Malignant cells can evade immune surveillance by (1) avoiding being localized by immune effector cells or being recognized as neoplastic (camouflage), (2) preventing immune cell activation despite being localized and recognized as neoplastic (coercion), or (3) protecting themselves from immune cytotoxicity in the context of normal immune cell activation (cytoprotection).

## Camouflage

One major strategy for malignant cells to evade immunosurveillance relies on their ability to hide from immune effector cells, i.e., to avoid being localized by immune effector cells or being recognized as transformed. Such a camouflage can results from defects in antigen processing and presentation, from the limited secretion of chemotactic factors associated or not with immunogenic cell death (ICD), or from the creation of stromal barriers preventing immune infiltration ([Figure 2](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#fig2)).

Figure 2 Camouflage in cancer immune evasion

Neoplastic cells can avert tumor-targeting immunity through multiple alterations that ultimately prevent them from being detected or contacted by immune effector cells. These include (but may not be limited to) (1) defects in the antigen and presentation (APP) machinery, as exemplified by mutations in genes encoding MHC molecules or the obligate MHC class I interactor beta-2 microglobulin (*B2M*), which prevents the recognition of malignant cells by CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (A); (2) a defective recruitment of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or the precursors thereof to the tumor bed, as exemplified by the upregulation of enzymes that convert extracellular ATP into adenosine, such as ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (ENTPD1, best known as CD39), ectonucleotidase 5′-nucleotidase ecto (5NTE, best known as CD73) as well as the downregulation of autophagy (B); (3) defects in the engagement of phagocytosis by APCs, as exemplified by a variety of mechanisms preventing the immunogenic cell death (ICD)-associated exposure of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone calreticulin (CALR) on the cell surface (C); and (4) the physical exclusion of immune effector cells from cancer cell nests, as exemplified by the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-driven and transforming growth factor β 1 (TGFB1)-dependent establishment of a dense, collagen-rich stromal reaction (D).

### Antigen processing and presentation defects

Both mutational and non-mutational events provide cancer cells with a distinct antigenic landscape compared to their normal counterparts, at least theoretically increasing their visibility CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs.[<sup>18</sup>](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#)

### Exclusion

At least in some instance, malignant cells evade immunosurveillance by generating a physical barrier that impedes immune effector cell recruitment to the TME. Such a camouflage mechanism mainly stems from TME remodeling as mediated by specific immune and stromal cells or from the reconfiguration of the extracellular matrix (ECM).

Altogether, exclusion stands out as a major mechanism through which malignant cells camouflage from the host immune system. That said, whether exclusion can be targeted therapeutically in support of restored immunosurveillance and improved ICI sensitivity remains to be clinically demonstrated.

## Coercion

Malignant cells that fail at camouflage (and hence are found and identified as transformed by the immune system) can evade anticancer immunity by suppressing the activity of immune effector cells including (but potentially not limited to) DCs, NK cells, T<sub>H</sub>1-polarized CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs, as well as by promoting the activity of immunosuppressive cells such as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (T<sub>REG</sub>) cells, specific TAM subsets, and MDSCs. Such a coercive activity can be the result of numerous alterations that involve shifts in the expression of immunomodulatory ligands on the cancer cell surface, defects in DAMP or pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling and/or the release of immunomodulatory metabolites in the TME ([Figure 3](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#fig3)).

Developing neoplasms often acquire a number of alterations that actively inhibit tumor-targeting immune responses, either directly—by quenching the activity of immune effector cells, such as CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells—or indirectly—by promoting the regulatory functions of their immunosuppressive counterparts, such as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (T<sub>REG</sub>) cells. The alterations encompass (1) shifts in the expression of immunomodulatory ligands, as exemplified by changes in the expression pattern of NK cell-activating ligands (NKALs) or NK cell-inhibitory ligands (NKILs) (A); (2) defects in pattern recognition receptor (PRR), damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) or type I interferon (IFN) signaling, as exemplified by a variety of mechanisms that actively suppress viral mimicry (B); (3) alterations in the cancer cell secretome that affect cytokines other than type I IFN, as exemplified by the oversecretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) (C); and (4) by a number of metabolic alterations that ultimately impact immune cell functions, such as the abundant secretion of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>; D).

### Alterations in immunomodulatory ligands

Most neoplastic cells are characterized by an altered surface phenotype that encompasses reduced MHC levels in support of camouflage (mentioned previously) as well as changes in the expression of ligands for immune cell receptors with immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive effects.

#### PD-L1

CD274 (best known as PD-L1) is arguably the best characterized surface molecule that cancer cells harness in support of direct coercion, largely reflecting its ability to suppress the effector functions of CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs,[<sup>116</sup>](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#)

#### NK cell-interacting ligands

*Cancer Cell.* 2023; **41**:272-287.e9Since this would come at the cost of potentially losing camouflage from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, it is tempting to speculate that cancer cells may benefit from reduced MHC class I levels (to camouflage from adaptive immunity) but not absent (to coerce innate immunity as mediated by NK cells). Alternatively, it is plausible that different tumors (or different areas of the same malignant lesion) may preferentially develop camouflage vs. coercion strategy depending on the type of immune pression they are facing. Despite these and other unknowns, it is worth noting that the interaction between HLA-E and its cognate NK cell-inhibitory receptor (NKIR), namely killer cell lectin like receptor C1 (KLRC1, best known as NKG2A) has been harnessed for the development of a monoclonal antibody (monalizumab)[<sup>145</sup>](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#)

In summary, targeting the mechanisms through which cancer cells coerce NK cells stands out as a promising strategy to circumvent immune evasion, especially for malignancies that exhibit superior sensitivity to NK cell-mediated immunosurveillance (e.g., hematological tumors).

#### Other immunomodulatory ligands

Several other surface proteins are harnessed by malignant cells to coerce CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, NK cells, and APCs. For instance, in PDAC models, overexpression of PVR cell adhesion molecule (PVR, also known as CD155) has been shown to promote and sustain immune escape upon inhibition of the T cell and NK cell co-inhibitory receptor T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT).[<sup>148</sup>](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#)

### Defective PRR, DAMP, and type I IFN signaling

In many malignant cells, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the emission of immunostimulatory DAMPs and cytokines, be them related to ICD or not, are dysfunctional or actively counterbalanced, resulting in the establishment of microenvironmental conditions that are not permissive for anticancer immunity.

#### Defective CGAS-STING1 signaling

Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (CGAS) is a sensor of cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that elicits pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs executed by interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, and NF-κB upon activation of stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1 (STING1, best known as STING) and consequent TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) signaling.[<sup>162</sup>](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#)

#### Chronic type I interferon signaling

At least some neoplastic cells can coerce type I interferon signaling in support of local immunosuppression and accelerated disease progression, most likely reflecting the fundamental difference between acute and resolving inflammatory processes (which generally promote immunosurveillance) versus chronic and indolent inflammation (which generally supports immunoevasion).[<sup>235</sup>](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#)

### Altered secretion of other cytokines

Multiple tumors evade anticancer immunity by alterations in their secretome that involve an accrued production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and/or a defective release of pro-inflammatory factors other than type I IFN.

#### Secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines

Multiple cancer types can secrete cytokines that favor the establishment of local and/or systemic immunosuppression. For instance, prostate cancer cells have been shown to secrete CCL2 downstream of PRC1-dependent epigenetic alterations, culminating with the recruitment of immunosuppressive M2-like TAMs and T<sub>REG</sub> cells, which facilitate tumor dissemination.[<sup>243</sup>](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#)

## Cytoprotection

Both CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs and NK cells kill malignant cells upon the establishment of the so-called “immunological synapse”, a highly organized structure that physically connects immune effector cells with their targets and enables the polarized (1) release of cytotoxic molecules including GZMB and PRF1; (2) expression of death receptor ligands, such as Fas ligand (FASLG); and (3) release of tumor-targeting cytokines, notably IFNG.[<sup>359</sup>](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#)

*Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.* 2016; **32**:303-325Neoplastic cells can evade immune elimination by effector cells that normally recognize them as transformed and hence normally engage in cytotoxic and secretory functions though a variety of cytoprotective mechanisms that either involve defects in the formation of the immunological synapse or the activation of cell death pathways downstream thereof, or rely on the initiation of compensatory responses such as autophagy ([Figure 4](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#fig4)).

Figure 4 Cytoprotection in cancer immune evasion

Cancer cells of different histology can evade tumor-targeting immune responses by acquiring an increased resistance to immune effector molecules such as perforin 1 (PRF1), granzyme B (GZMB), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or interferon gamma (IFNG). Such a decreased sensitivity to cytolysis by immune effector cells can involve (1) mechanical defects of the immune synapse, generally resulting in inhibited PRF1-mediated pore formation or improved endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent membrane repair (A): (2) defects in Fas cell surface death receptor (FAS) and IFNG signal transduction, at least in some cases linked to caspase 8 (*CASP8*) and Janus kinase 1 (*JAK1*) mutations (B); and (3) the activation of compensatory cytoprotective pathways including (but not limited to) autophagy (C).

### Alterations of the immunological synapse

At least in some cases, cancer cells evade immune cytotoxicity via mechanical properties that result in decreased sensitivity to GZMB and PRF1. For instance, TRCs appear to evade immune attack due to their unique cellular softness as compared to their more differentiated counterparts, resulting in insufficient contractile force for PRF1 pore formation at the immunological synapse, at least in preclinical melanoma and breast cancer models.[<sup>360</sup>](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#)

Despite this and other unknowns, simultaneously targeting camouflage and coercion stands out as a promising approach to avert immuno evasion in a variety of tumors as it potentially addresses elevated degree of intratumoral heterogeneity that may be associated with the acquisition of different immunoevasive properties by malignant cells in different tumor areas.

## Concluding remarks

Here, we propose a novel conceptual framework to classify cancer immunoevasion by suggesting that most mechanisms through which malignant cells escape immune recognition and elimination involve either of “three Cs”: camouflage, coercion, or cytoprotection. Such a framework is obviously not devoid of limitations. For instance, some malignant cells exhibit genetic or epigenetic defects that simultaneously engage more than one “C”. As a standalone example, EZH2 has been shown to promote both camouflage and coercion, downstream of the epigenetic silencing of MHC class I molecules, STING, and pro-inflammatory cytokines.[<sup>30</sup>](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#)

**Opposing Functions of Interferon Coordinate Adaptive and Innate Immune Responses to Cancer Immune Checkpoint Blockade**

*Cell.* 2019; **178**:933-948.e14Whether diagnostic tests assessing IFNG signaling in malignant cells as a predictor of ICI sensitivity will soon enter the clinical routine, however, is unclear.

Despite these and other unknowns, we believe that the “three Cs” framework proposed herein may facilitate the understanding of a complex phenomenon such as immune evasion, and potentially guide the discovery of novel, clinically relevant strategies to circumvent it.
